# KNN Model README

This repository contains a KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) model implemented in Python using the pandas, numpy, joblib, and sklearn libraries.

## Overview

The KNN model is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the K nearest neighbors to a given data point and making predictions based on the majority class or average value of those neighbors.

## Dependencies

To run the KNN model, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- pandas (version X.X.X)
- numpy (version X.X.X)
- joblib (version X.X.X)
- sklearn (version X.X.X)
